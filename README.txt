Music:

The game will shuffle through any mp3s placed in the Music folder.


How to Play:

Navigate the level, pick up powerups and blow the
other ships to smithereens! There's more than one game type:

Survival:   Be the last one alive
Frag Limit: Be the first to kill a certain number of ships
Time Limit: Try to kill more ships than the others in the time limit
Squad:      Same as survival, but with a different ship for each life

In all of these modes there are 4 different teams, which default
to a different team per ship (i.e. each ship for itself). Teams
can be selected so that 2 vs 2, 1 vs 3 and 1 vs 2 matches can
be played.


Controls:

The keys can be defined in the options sub-menu, and joysticks
and keyboards can be used as control devices.

Thrust accelerates the ship in the direction it's facing
Left/Right rotate the ship anti-clockwise/clockwise respectively
Weapon fires the ship's primary weapon
Special fires the ship's special weapon/ability
Super uses the ship's super move
Start/Pause does what it says...

If Start and Super are set to the same key (useful for players using
keyboards), then the Super is executed by pressing Weapon+Special
at the same time.

If more than human player is using the keyboard, then on the ship
selection screen and pause menu the controls are set to the ship
controls (up is thrust, down is special, enter is weapon and esc/cancel
is start), instead of the cursor keys and enter.

As the name of the game suggests, gravity plays an important role
in its physics. Ships (and certain projectiles) will fall constantly
unless made to thrust upwards.


Landing:

If a ship hits any part of the level it will suffer damage, unless
it hits it with its rear. Turn the ship around as it flies against
the level to bounce back instead.


Bases:

Ships resting on a base will repair their hull and fill up their
special gauge. This is shown by a flashing aura around the ship.


Ships:

Each ship has a different set of stats for in-game variables and
its own set of weapons/abilities, which consist of a primary weapon,
a special, and a super move. 

Primary weapons are limitless, but will heat up if used too often,
which causes them to fire less frequently. Simply stop firing and it
will cool down.

Special weapons and abilities use up the special gauge, which can be
represented in two different ways depending on the ship: either with
a special bar or a certain number of weapons. The special gauge
regenerates very slowly (unless the ship goes to a base).

Supers can be used once the super gauge is filled, which is indicated
by an S next to the ship's stats. This gauge is filled by dealing damage
to other ships. Supers are usually the most powerful weapons in the
game. During the execution of a super move, the ship remains stationary
and is only able to rotate (to aim the super). It still takes damage
from projectiles, however.
